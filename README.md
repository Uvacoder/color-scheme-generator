## Usage
Enter a `brand color`, or randomly generate one, and the rest of the colors will match. The greys also subtly tints with your `brand color`.

The input accepts most color formats, for example:
* Hex - `#f93, FF9933`
* RGB - `rgb(255, 200, 50)`
* HSL - `hsl(10, 66%, 70%)`
* Named CSS colors - `tomato, royalBlue`
